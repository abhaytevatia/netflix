# Netflix Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's content, focusing on the type of content available in different countries, trends in TV shows and movies, and clustering similar content. The project also explores the possibility of integrating external datasets such as IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomatoes to gain deeper insights into Netflix's content library.

## Project Overview

Netflix, Inc. is an American subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service and production company based in Los Gatos, California. Founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph, Netflix offers a vast library of films and television series through distribution deals and its own original productions.

### Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the Netflix dataset to gain a better understanding of its contents and trends over the years.

2. **Understanding Content Availability:** Explore the types of content available in different countries and regions.

3. **TV vs. Movies:** Investigate whether Netflix has shifted its focus towards TV shows in recent years as opposed to movies.

4. **Content Clustering:** Cluster similar content by matching text-based features to identify patterns and group content into categories.

5. **Integration of External Datasets:** Explore the potential of integrating external datasets, such as IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomatoes scores, to enhance the analysis and obtain more meaningful insights.

### Problem Statement

The dataset used in this project contains information about TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. In 2018, a report revealed a significant increase in the number of TV shows on Netflix since 2010, while the number of movies decreased. This project aims to delve deeper into the dataset and discover other valuable insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is collected from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine. It provides details about the title, director, cast, release year, rating, duration, and the country in which the content is available.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main sections and folders:

1. **Data:** This folder contains the dataset used for analysis.

2. **Notebooks:** This directory contains Jupyter notebooks where the data analysis, EDA, and clustering are performed.

3. **Results:** In this folder, you can find the results and visualizations generated during the analysis.

4. **External Data:** If external datasets like IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomatoes data are integrated, they will be stored here.

5. **README.md:** You are currently reading this file, which provides an overview of the project.

## Dependencies

The analysis is conducted using Python and various libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn. Make sure you have these dependencies installed to run the Jupyter notebooks.

## Usage

You can explore the project's notebooks to understand the analysis process and findings. Feel free to run the notebooks to reproduce the results or modify the code to conduct your own analysis. If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue or contact the project contributors.
